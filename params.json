This program was created in STS. After running into several problems, however, a new repository was created and a fresh, working project was pushed to it. This program has a substantial history that displays edits from all team members prior to the creation of the fresh repository.\r\n\r\n[sqldatabaseapp](https://github.com/Team-5/sqldatabaseapp)\r\n\r\nThe \"CustomerDatabaseApp\" repository is the newly-updated, fresh copy of the SQL project. This program runs without the errors of its predecessor. It was created in NetBeans, not STS. All the images of the working SQL project will be referencing this repository, not he \"sqldatabaseapp\" repository.\r\n \r\n[CustomerDatabseApp](https://github.com/Team-5/CustomerDatabaseApp)\r\n\r\n[Images]()\r\n",
