<a id="team-trello-board" class="anchor" href="#team-trello-board" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Team Trello Board</h2>

<p>Our team Trello board is filled with information. We placed the current sprint's completed tasks to the far left followed by the current tasks that have not yet been completed. After that we have some brief additional information including an image of our team bulletin board and a description of our team's labeling system. This system uses the colors green, yellow, orange, and red to estimate a tasks relative length or difficulty. The color blue shows that a task has been completed by all members, and the color purple indicates that the task is to be completed individually instead of as a team. We then have each of our team member's highlights lists, all of which are relatively similar in length (some appear much longer than others due to the in-depth descriptions that certain members added to each of their cards). These highlights give details about what each member did throughout the course, including extra credit opportunities and additional work other than what was assigned. The next list contains the contact information for each member as well as important links such as a link to the class Trello board, team GitHub site, etc. The last element of the Trello board are the records for precious sprints. As soon as a sprint is completed it was moved to the back of the list in order to make room for the next sprint.</p>

<a id="bulletin-board" class="anchor" href="#bulletin-board" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Bulletin Board</h2>

<p>Our team decided to make research and design a bulletin board about the various careers that can be found in the Computer Science and Computer Information Systems fields. As you can see from the image below, the design is very clean and the colors contrast each other. We decided to narrow our search down to the Top 10 careers. Each career has a brief description of the tasks and duties one can expect to be faced with as well as a possible salary range. The overall design of the bulletin board is not overly complex, which makes it easy to comprehend what is going on. Lisa Caswell took the lead on the bulletin board's design and she was assisted by Willie Scott and Jeremy Wiles. All team members contributed to possible bulletin board ideas and elements.</p>

<a id="github-repositories" class="anchor" href="#github-repositories" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>GitHub Repositories</h2>

<p>The "sqldatabaseapp" repository was our team's original repository for the main SQL project. This program was created in STS. After running into several problems, however, a new repository was created and a fresh, working project was pushed to it. This program has a substantial history that displays edits from team members prior to the creation of the fresh repository. This is <strong>NOT</strong> the team's final repository. Again, we discarded this repository after running into a slew of errors. We decided not to delete it since its commit history might be useful in the final evaluation.</p>

<p>The "CustomerDatabaseApp" repository is the newly-updated, fresh copy of the team SQL project. This program runs without the errors of its predecessor. It was created in NetBeans, not STS. All the images below of the working SQL project will be images this repository, not the "sqldatabaseapp" repository. The "CustomerDatabaseApp" consists of all ten required menu items, all of which work, as well as significant Java documentation for each important method in the program. It also has all the basic JUnit tests that were required for the getter and setter methods. In addition to all of the required tasks, our team decided to use the last two weeks of class to create a GUI system for the program. We managed to get the GUI working splendidly and added each of the ten menu items as well as an additional "clear" button to help keep the display from getting cluttered.</p>
